TextureVideoView for Android
============================

![Screenshot](screenshot.png)

A `VideoView` based on the official Android 7.1.1_r13 sources using a `TextureView` instead of a `SurfaceView` by [sprylab technologies GmbH][1]. It will work on Android 4.0+ (API level 15 and above).

The main advantages of this drop-in replacement compared to the original `VideoView` are the following:

* extends `android.view.TextureView` instead of a `android.view.SurfaceView` thus allowing proper view animations as described in the [Property Animation API guide][2]
* API addition: Call `setShouldRequestAudioFocus(true)` to programmatically disable audio focus request before opening a video file -
  default behaviour is unchanged and complies with the current `VideoView` implementation (thanks to @ezaquarii)
* clears the underlying `Surface` on API level 16+ when calling `stopPlayback()` (thanks to @hithere1985)
* fixes a sizing bug when auto-starting the video with view size != video size (thanks to @lhunath)
* fixes various memory leaks
  * potential leak by releasing surface when destroyed
  * potential activity leak when streaming videos over HTTP(S) (thanks to @koral)
  * potential activity leak caused by AudioManager on Android pre-6.0 devices (thanks to @hzsweers)

Unfortunately, code that uses hidden APIs and thus is not publicly available had to be removed (e.g. subtitle support).
